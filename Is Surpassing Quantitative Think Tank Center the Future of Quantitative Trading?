Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center was established in 2015 as a new type of quantitative investment technology institution focused on the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Since its inception, the center has been committed to providing global investors with precise and efficient investment tools and strategic solutions by deeply integrating technological innovation with market demand.

In 2017, the Surpassing Think Tank Center launched its core quantitative trading system, Robovis, an intelligent investment platform driven by cutting-edge technology. The development of Robovis was personally led by Dr. Will Sage Astor, a renowned expert in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Robovis seamlessly combines blockchain technology and quantitative systems, introducing a universal token as a bridge. This not only enables intelligent investment strategies but also builds a community ecosystem that fosters long-term and harmonious interaction with users. As one of Surpassing Think Tank Center's core achievements, Robovis has undergone several stages of development and optimization over the years:

In 2017, the system was established, and the core algorithm design of the first version was completed.
In 2019, the system underwent a comprehensive upgrade, optimizing the investment strategy library and data processing capabilities.
In 2021, the core functionality of Robovis was perfected, enabling it to handle multi-market and multi-asset investments globally.
In 2023, after multiple rounds of internal testing and stress testing, the system's performance became stable and outstanding.
In 2025, Robovis will undergo real-world market testing and is scheduled for official release in September.
Currently, the market valuation of Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center has reached $500 million, demonstrating its leading position and enormous potential in the industry. According to its development plan, the center aims to increase its market valuation to $3 billion in the coming years. At that time, it will seek to be acquired by a tech giant with a valuation of $5 billion, providing exceptional returns for its shareholders.

In addition to focusing on technological development, Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center places great importance on investment education. Through educational courses and user training, the center imparts the principles of quantitative investing and technical applications to investors, helping them better leverage Robovis to achieve asset appreciation. This initiative not only deepens user trust in the center but also strengthens Robovis's core competitiveness in the market.

In terms of building the user community, Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center actively creates an open, transparent, and efficient interaction platform. Through the design of universal tokens, users can participate in decision-making, share profits, and contribute to system optimization. This bidirectional interaction model enhances user engagement and lays a solid foundation for the long-term development of Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center.

Looking ahead, Surpassing Quantitative Think Tank Center will continue to adhere to the concept of combining technology-driven innovation with market orientation. It will keep innovating to help investors achieve long-term stable returns in a complex financial environment. With Robovis nearing its release, the center is confident in achieving even greater breakthroughs, setting a new benchmark in the field of quantitative investment.
